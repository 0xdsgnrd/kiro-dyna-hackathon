## Goal
[One sentence describing the intended outcome or user value.]

## Description
[Brief context: what exists today, what's missing, and why this work matters now.]

---

## Requirements
[High-level overview of what needs to be built or changed.]

- [Specific capability or behavior]
- [Specific capability or behavior]
- [Specific capability or behavior]
- [Specific capability or behavior]

[Any important constraints, assumptions, or interactions between requirements.]

### Non-Goals
- [Explicitly out of scope]
- [Deferred or intentionally excluded functionality]

---

## Acceptance Criteria
> Acceptance criteria should be observable, testable outcomes — not implementation tasks. Aim for 3-7 criteria; more suggests the ticket should be split.

- [ ] [Clear, measurable outcome]
- [ ] [Edge case or failure behavior handled]
- [ ] [Compatibility, performance, or security requirement]
- [ ] [Consistency with existing patterns or standards]

---

## Technical Context
> Constraints, architectural considerations, or important context for implementers — not prescriptive implementation details.

- [Implementation constraint or architectural consideration]
- [Preferred technology, library, or pattern (with rationale)]
- [Performance, security, or observability consideration]

---

## Risks / Open Questions
- [Known risk, dependency, or tradeoff]
- [Decision required or unknown to resolve]

---

## Dependencies
- [Blocking ticket or external dependency]
- [Related work or prerequisite]

---

## Success Metrics *(optional)*
- [Measurable impact if applicable, e.g., "reduce API latency by 200ms"]
- [User behavior change, adoption target, etc.]

---

## Design / Mockups *(optional)*
[Link to design document, screenshots, or wireframes if UI work is involved]

---

## Definition of Done
> Ticket-specific completion criteria. Standard DoD items (tests passing, no TODOs, docs updated) are assumed unless noted otherwise.

- All acceptance criteria met
- [Any additional ticket-specific requirements, e.g., "migration script tested in staging environment"]
